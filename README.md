# The Roll Play

The Roll Play is a Flutter-based story creation app available on web, Android, and iOS, designed to enable real-time role-playing experiences. Users can create and manage their own characters, engage in collaborative storytelling through story posts, decision-making dice rolls, and out-of-character (OOC) comments. Stories can be private or public, with sharing options to foster community interaction. Email and in-app notifications keep authors updated on story activity and new features. Leveraging AI tools (Grok, ChatGPT) for code optimization and debugging, the app delivers a seamless and engaging user experience across platforms.
